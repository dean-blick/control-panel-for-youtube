## Bug reports

To report a bug, [create a new Issue](/issues/new).

Please include:

- The version of Control Panel for YouTube you're using
- The browser and operating system you're using it on
- Relevant URLs when shareable (e.g. a YouTube video a feature isn't working on)

Screenshots would be appreciated where a feature should be hiding something but isn't, as you may be seeing something we haven't encountered during development, particularly on your personal Home and Subscriptions pages.

If you're familiar with web development, a snapshot of the `outerHTML` of specific elements a feature isn't working on would also be appreciated if you think it would be relevant.
